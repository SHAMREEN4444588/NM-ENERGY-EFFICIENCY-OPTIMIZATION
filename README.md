Energy Efficiency Optimization Overview
Energy efficiency optimization involves refining software, hardware, or systems to minimize energy consumption while maintaining or improving performance. For a GitHub project, this could mean:
- Optimizing Code Efficiency – Reducing computational complexity, eliminating redundant operations, and utilizing efficient algorithms.
- Reducing Resource Consumption – Ensuring that memory, processing power, and disk usage are optimized.
- Utilizing Energy-Efficient Frameworks – Choosing libraries and frameworks designed for minimal resource consumption.
- Implementing Adaptive Workflows – Dynamically adjusting processing needs based on demand to save energy.
- Monitoring and Benchmarking – Regularly analyzing energy usage and optimizing areas with high consumption.
